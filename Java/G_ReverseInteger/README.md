# Reverse Integer 

## Description

Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.

```
Example 1:

Input: 123
Output: 321

Example 2:

Input: -123
Output: -321

Example 3:

Input: 120
Output: 21
Note:
Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231,  231 − 1]. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.


```

## Solution

### Pseudo code:

**My Solution:**

_Step 1:_ Divide (/) and perform mod (%) the given integer by 10 and store the output in 2 different datatypes and add the mod result to a String.

_Step 2:_ Loop the above until you have all the numbers in the given integer.

**_Time complexity:_**  O(n) for removing the zeros at the end and O(n) for reversing the integer. So the total time will be O(n)

**_Space Complexity:_** O(1)

**Why is it failing?**

The logic is complex and the overflow is not handled properly
