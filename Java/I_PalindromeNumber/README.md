# Palindrome Number

## Description

Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

```
Example 1:

Input: 121
Output: true

Example 2:

Input: -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

Example 3:

Input: 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.


```

Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?
